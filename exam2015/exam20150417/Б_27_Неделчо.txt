Article_26 has a one to one connection to Category
Category has a many to many connection to User
As a result SQL queries must be created
Write the queries from point 1 and 2 in a file called creates.sql

As a result SQL queries must be created
Write the queries from point 3 in a file called inserts.sql

4. Answer the following question
Which are the Category(s) for a given Tag
As a result SQL query must be created
Write the queries from points 4 in a file called selects1.sql

5. Export the Data Base to SQL or CSV

6. Execute the following migration
Separate Article_26 on two tables
Article_26_part1 containing created_on
Article_26_part2 containing all the other fields
As a result SQL queries+code in other programming language must be create.

7. Export the Data Base to SQL or CSV

8. Answer the following question
Which are the User(s) for a given Article_26
As a result SQL query must be created
Write the queries from points 8 in a file called selects2.sql

9. Draw a picture of the database

10. Add all the files in a folder called FirstName_LastName_Class_Number
Create a zip from this folder and name the zip FirstName_LastName_Class_Number.zip
(here FirstName is your first name, LastName is your last name, class is A or B and Number is your number in class)

Good luck and may the force be with you!
